# Java Exercises Thread

https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/thread/index.php
In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the  operating system. The implementation of threads and  processes differs between  operating systems.

A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The  Java Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently.

Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in some thread creates a new Thread object, the new thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the creating thread is a daemon.


### 1. Write a Java program to create a basic Java thread that prints " Hello, World!" when executed.



### 2. Write a Java program that creates two threads to find and print even and odd numbers from 1 to 20.



### 3. Write a Java program that sorts an array of integers using multiple threads.



### 4. Write a Java program that performs matrix multiplication using multiple threads.



### 5. Write a Java program that calculates the sum of all prime numbers up to a given limit using multiple threads.



### 6. Write a Java program to implement a concurrent web crawler that crawls multiple websites simultaneously using threads.



### 7. Write a Java program that creates a bank account with concurrent deposits and withdrawals using threads.
