# Java Exercises Abstract

https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/index-abstract.php
All  programming languages provide abstractions. It can be argued that the complexity of the problems youâ€™re able to solve is directly related to the kind and quality of abstraction. An essential element of object-oriented programming is an abstraction. For more information read this article.

### 1. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Animal with an abstract method called sound(). Create subclasses Lion and Tiger that extend the Animal class and implement the sound() method to make a specific sound for each animal.


### 2. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Shape with abstract methods calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter(). Create subclasses Circle and Triangle that extend the Shape class and implement the respective methods to calculate the area and perimeter of each shape.


### 3. Write a Java program to create an abstract class BankAccount with abstract methods deposit() and withdraw(). Create subclasses: SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount that extend the BankAccount class and implement the respective methods to handle deposits and withdrawals for each account type.


### 4. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Animal with abstract methods eat() and sleep(). Create subclasses Lion, Tiger, and Deer that extend the Animal class and implement the eat() and sleep() methods differently based on their specific behavior.


### 5. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Employee with abstract methods calculateSalary() and displayInfo(). Create subclasses Manager and Programmer that extend the Employee class and implement the respective methods to calculate salary and display information for each role.


### 6. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Shape3D with abstract methods calculateVolume() and calculateSurfaceArea(). Create subclasses Sphere and Cube that extend the Shape3D class and implement the respective methods to calculate the volume and surface area of each shape.


### 7. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Vehicle with abstract methods startEngine() and stopEngine(). Create subclasses Car and Motorcycle that extend the Vehicle class and implement the respective methods to start and stop the engines for each vehicle type.


### 8. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Person with abstract methods eat() and exercise(). Create subclasses Athlete and LazyPerson that extend the Person class and implement the respective methods to describe how each person eats and exercises.


### 9. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Instrument with abstract methods play() and tune(). Create subclasses for Glockenspiel and Violin that extend the Instrument class and implement the respective methods to play and tune each instrument.


### 10. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Shape2D with abstract methods draw() and resize(). Create subclasses Rectangle and Circle that extend the Shape2D class and implement the respective methods to draw and resize each shape.


### 11. Write a Java program to create an abstract class Bird with abstract methods fly() and makeSound(). Create subclasses Eagle and Hawk that extend the Bird class and implement the respective methods to describe how each bird flies and makes a sound.


### 12. Write a Java program to create an abstract class GeometricShape with abstract methods area() and perimeter(). Create subclasses Triangle and Square that extend the GeometricShape class and implement the respective methods to calculate the area and perimeter of each shape.
