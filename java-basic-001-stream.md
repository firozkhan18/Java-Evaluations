# Java Stream

A Stream in Java can be defined as a sequence of elements from a source, such as arrays, List, Set or any other collection.

Streams are lazily operated, opposite to collections that must store all the values before it starts processing. Stream is conceptually a pipeline, in which elements are computed on demand.

This page lists down the published tutorials on this blog related to Stream API and its related concepts.
