Java Encapsulation:

An object's encapsulation allows it to hide its data and methods. It is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. Java classes encapsulate the fields and methods that define an object's state and actions. Encapsulation enables you to write reusable programs. It also enables you to restrict access only to public features of an object. Other fields and methods are private and can be used internally.

### 1. Write a Java program to create a class called Person with private instance variables name, age. and country. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify these variables.



### 2. Write a Java program to create a class called BankAccount with private instance variables accountNumber and balance. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify these variables.



### 3. Write a Java program to create a class called Rectangle with private instance variables length and width. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify these variables.



### 4. Write a Java program to create a class called Employee with private instance variables employee_id, employee_name, and employee_salary. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the id and name variables, but provide a getter method for the salary variable that returns a formatted string.



### 5. Write a Java program to create a class called Circle with a private instance variable radius. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the radius variable. However, provide two methods called calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter() that return the calculated area and perimeter based on the current radius value.



### 6. Write a Java program to create a class called Car with private instance variables company_name, model_name, year, and mileage. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the company_name, model_name, and year variables. However, only provide a getter method for the mileage variable.



### 7. Write a Java program to create a class called Student with private instance variables student_id, student_name, and grades. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the student_id and student_name variables. However, provide a method called addGrade() that allows adding a grade to the grades variable while performing additional validation.
