Generic Methods:

Generic methods are methods that introduce their own type parameters. This is similar to declaring a generic type, but the type parameter's scope is limited to the method where it is declared. Static and non-static generic methods are allowed, as well as generic class constructors.

The syntax for a generic method includes a list of type parameters, inside angle brackets, which appears before the method's return type. For static generic methods, the type parameter section must appear before the method's return type

### 1. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes two arrays of the same type and checks if they have the same elements in the same order.



### 2. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even and odd numbers.



### 3. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes a list of any type and a target element. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element in the list. Return -1 if the target element cannot be found.



### 4. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes a list of any type and returns it as a new list with the elements in reverse order.



### 5. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes two lists of the same type and merges them into a single list. This method alternates the elements of each list.



### 6. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes a list of any type and a predicate. It returns an array list containing only elements that satisfy the predicate.



### 7. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes a map of any type and prints each key-value pair.
